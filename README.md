Vibey is a social platform that allows users to explore or host music rooms and listen together in real-time.  Vibey leverages WebSockets and the Spotify API to allow hosts to actively queue up playlists and actively reverse, skip, seek, pause, and play, all while keeping things in-time with other users.
